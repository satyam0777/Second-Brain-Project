# 🧠 Second Brain

A digital productivity tool designed to help users manage their thoughts, documents, and bookmarks effectively — acting as an external "second brain."

##  Why I Built This

In today’s fast-paced digital world, many people — including skilled individuals — face **short-term memory loss or cognitive overload**, leading to missed opportunities. Even those with high IQ or great technical skills can be overlooked simply because they struggle to remember everything on the spot.

This project was born out of a personal realization and observation:

> "People are often judged by what they remember — not necessarily what they can do."

As someone who comes from a local area where note-taking and information organization tools are rare, I wanted to create a system that helps users **capture, store, and recall** their ideas — like a second brain.
